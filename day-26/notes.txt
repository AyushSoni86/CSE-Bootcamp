String is class present in java.lang package
String is a reference datatype
String is group of characters
String is an object

In how many ways we can initialize a String?
In two ways -
    1. Using the literal ways
        e.g: String name = "Shreya Sakshi";
    2. Using the new Keyword
        e.g:   String name = new String("Sakshi");
